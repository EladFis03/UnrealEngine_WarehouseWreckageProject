# UnrealEngine_WarehouseWreckageProject
The first project I did in my online course: Unreal Engine 5: C++ Developer, by GameDev.tv Team.

## Summary
A small FPS game to test the physics of the Unreal Engine 5.
You are in a small room with barrels to shoot at.
You use the classic movements "W/S/A/D", and "E/Q" to move up/down, respectively.
You can shoot with the left mouse button, and reload with the right mouse button.
You'll see the ammo you currently have in the debug UI during the build's run. 
To reset the run entirely, press the "R" key.

## The Project
It was fun designing the room and working with the physics of the engine.
I also learned how to add audio files, and I kind of had fun with it, as you'll soon see :)


## Thank you and have fun
